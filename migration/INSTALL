Installing libmigration
-----------------------

The libmigration library is needed by all multi-ISA applications, and therefore
needs to be compiled for all architectures in the system.  The Makefile handles
this, however.

NOTE: libmigration is built againts Popcorn's musl-libc.  Please install it for
all architectures in /usr/local/popcorn/<arch> before continuing -- it is
important to compile against musl-libc, otherwise gcc will default to compiling
against glibc and glibc-specific symbols will creep into the library.  This
will lead to undefined/unresolved symbols when compiling applications.

1. Build & install libmigration for aarch64 & x86_64:

  $ make install

2. You can speed up the build by enabling parallel jobs:

  $ make -j<# of parallel jobs>

3. The library can be built in several different configurations:

  - Selecting migration via environment variables: rather than migrating when
    told by the scheduler, migrate at a point specified by environment
    variables (see util/scripts/test-migration.py for more information on how
    to choose a migration point) 

    $ make type=env_select install

  - Native execution: do all the normal pre-migration setup steps but do not
    migrate.  In other words, do native stack transformation (e.g., x86-64 ->
    86-64), switch to the rewritten stack and continue execution on the current
    architecture with the rewritten stack.

    $ make type=native install

  - Debug: after a migration, spin indefinitely on the destination
    architecture.  This gives the user a chance to attach to the migrated
    application post-migration for debugging.

    $ make type=debug install

    Debugging on the destination architecture: after migration, users should
    first attach to the application on the destination system:

    $ gdb <binary>
    $ (gdb) attach <PID>

    Next, set the __hold variable to break out of the indefinite loop:

    $ (gdb) set __hold=0

    Now, the user can continue debugging as normal by setting breakpoints,
    stepping through functions, etc.
    
  - Timing: time the stack transformation latency and print to stdout:

    $ make type=timing install

4. Most of these options can be composed, e.g., to select the migration point
   and time stack transformation all on a native machine:

  $ make type=env_select,native,timing install
