Compile:
	gcc server.c -o server_<PORT>

Multiple Netswap Remote Daemons(NRD):
	To start multiple NRD, launch multiple server applications.
	To launch multiple servers, modify the PORT macro in server.c and compile.

- Run the server in a while loop for scheduler testing. Otherwise the server will go offline and subsequent clients would not establish connection.
- We used port numbers from 7080 to 7088 in the scheduler. So use the same port numbers for testing with scheduler.
